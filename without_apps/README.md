# General info

This dockerfile builds an eGroupware container. As You can see in the dockerfile, it is based on php 5.6.
You'll also need a MySQL or MariaDB container for the database.
I wanted to install for personal use the visol/egroupware container, but I couldn't reach jrenggli at visol and it seems he doesn't update his egroupware dockerfile- so I made my own and not just updated his file. 

# Egroupware
### General
Egroupware is a very powerful open source groupware programm. It consists of a calendar app, contacts, infolog, project manager, ticket system and more.
If you need more information on egroupware, just take a look here: [www.egroupware.org](http://www.egroupware.org)
Although this is a unofficial dockerfile, it uses just the official sources! 

### Version
This dockerfile installs Version 16.1.20160810 of egroupware

# 1. Installation / Configuration
## a) helpful script 
For starting, stopping and updating my egroupware containers, I use my script container_control.sh, which You can download from 
[github](https://github.com/sneakyx/egroupwareserver/blob/master/assets/container_control.sh)

## or b) without script

### Data directories (storage)
First, it would be wise to create directories for storing everything in place. I usually pack everything into subfolders under the same superior directory. This way it's easier to create a backup using rsync. (Remember to stop the database before creating a backup!)
I suggest the following directory hierarchy:

/home/egroupware/xxx/mysql  	-> Database
/home/egroupware/xxx/data  	-> Egroupware Files, backups and header.inc

	mkdir -p /home/egroupware/xxx/mysql /home/egroupware/xxx/data
-> Please replace xxx with Your favourite name! <-

### start mysql container

	docker run -d --name mysql-egroupware-xxx \
	-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 \
	-e MYSQL_DATABASE=egroupware \
	-e MYSQL_USER=egroupware \
	-e MYSQL_PASSWORD=123456 \
	-v /home/egroupware/xxx/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql
	
-> Please replace xxx with Your favourite name and 123456 with Your password! <-

### start egroupware container
To start the egroupware container, just use:

	docker run -d \
	--name egroupware-xxx \
	-p 4321:80 \
	-v /home/egroupware/xxx/data:/var/lib/egroupware \
	--link mysql-egroupware-xxx:mysql \
	sneaky/egroupware	

-> Please replace xxx with Your favourite name and 4321 with the port projected for using. If You don't want to map the port, just leave the line "-p 4321:80"<-

## 2. Setup Egroupware
### a) First time logging in?
If You started the image for first time, You have to login via
	
	http://ipOfYourServer:4321/

You don't have to add databse info during installation manually - I updated the files 
- class.setup_header.inc.php
- class.setup_process.inc.php
this way the installation is a bit more automated.
   
### or b) Logging in with existing database and data? 

If the file header.inc.php already exists (former installation), the docker-entrypoint.sh updates the database host ip and port in the header.inc.php automaticly!
 
If there's a new version of egroupware, You have to start the setup and update the database! (But egroupware will tell You this!) 

# 3. Additional info
Change all passwords from 123456 to Your own password! 

Remember to put the following informations external, otherwise all data will be lost after updating the image:
- folder for egroupware
- Mysql Database files
(see above for example directory hierarchy!)
